# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on creating and working with digital twins of robots using physics-based simulation environments. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical robot that allows for safe, repeatable experimentation without the risks and costs associated with real hardware.

In this module, you will learn:
- Physics-based simulation of robots and environments
- How to work with gravity, collisions, and dynamics in Gazebo
- High-fidelity visualization and interaction using Unity
- How to simulate various sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

Simulation-first learning is essential for accessibility and safety, allowing students to experiment with robot control and perception without requiring expensive hardware or facing safety concerns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
2. Implement realistic physics-based robot simulation
3. Simulate various sensor types and interpret their data
4. Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization and interaction
5. Validate robot behaviors in simulation before hardware deployment

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
- [Gazebo Simulation](./gazebo-simulation.md) - Physics-based simulation of robots and environments
- [Unity Integration](./unity-integration.md) - High-fidelity visualization and interaction
- [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md) - Simulating sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

Let's begin by exploring Gazebo simulation, one of the most widely used robotics simulators.
