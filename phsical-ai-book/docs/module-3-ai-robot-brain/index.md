# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on advanced AI integration with robotics using NVIDIA Isaac, which provides photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and specialized ROS pipelines for vision-based navigation and manipulation.

In this module, you will learn:
- Photorealistic simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Synthetic data generation techniques for perception models
- Isaac ROS pipelines for VSLAM and navigation
- Nav2-based path planning for bipedal humanoids

NVIDIA Isaac represents cutting-edge integration of AI with robotics, offering tools for creating realistic training data and deploying sophisticated perception and navigation systems that can handle the complexities of humanoid locomotion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Set up and use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
2. Generate synthetic data for training perception models
3. Implement Isaac ROS pipelines for visual SLAM and navigation
4. Configure Nav2-based path planning for bipedal humanoid robots
5. Integrate perception and navigation systems for complex robot behaviors
