# Module 5: The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone

## Overview

Welcome to Module 5 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book - the capstone project that integrates all concepts learned in previous modules. This module focuses on creating a complete autonomous humanoid system that demonstrates voice command → plan → navigate → perceive → manipulate workflow in simulation. This represents the culmination of your learning journey in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

In this module, you will learn:
- End-to-end system architecture for autonomous humanoid robots
- How to integrate all previous modules into a cohesive system
- Sim-to-real considerations for humanoid robotics
- Advanced debugging and validation techniques for complex systems

The capstone project demonstrates an autonomous humanoid in simulation that can respond to voice commands, plan actions, navigate environments, perceive objects, and execute tasks - showcasing the full Physical AI stack from perception to action.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Design and implement an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system
2. Integrate voice command processing with cognitive planning and execution
3. Create a complete workflow from voice command to physical action
4. Validate and debug complex multi-module robotic systems
5. Understand sim-to-real transfer considerations for humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
- [Capstone Architecture](./capstone-architecture.md) - System architecture and integration approach
- [Autonomous Humanoid Implementation](./autonomous-humanoid.md) - Complete implementation of the autonomous system

Let's begin by exploring the architecture for our complete autonomous humanoid system.
