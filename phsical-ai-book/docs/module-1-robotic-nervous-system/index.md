# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on the foundational concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications.

In this module, you will learn:
- The role of middleware in robot control
- Core ROS 2 concepts: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
- How to connect Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Robot modeling using URDF for humanoid structures

This module lays the groundwork for understanding how AI models connect with physical systems through proper middleware architecture, which is fundamental to the entire Physical AI approach.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Explain the role of ROS 2 as middleware in robotic systems
2. Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. Connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers
4. Model humanoid robot structures using URDF
5. Understand the communication patterns between AI models and robot controllers

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:
- [ROS 2 Concepts](./ros2-concepts.md) - Understanding the fundamentals of ROS 2
- [AI-ROS Integration](./ai-ros-integration.md) - Connecting Python AI agents to ROS controllers
- [URDF Modeling](./urdf-modeling.md) - Robot modeling for humanoid structures

Let's begin by exploring the core concepts of ROS 2.
